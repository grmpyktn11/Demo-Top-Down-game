# Demo Game
This is a game that I made in Unity and exported to Itch.io. It was a demonstration for some simple game features.
My friends were curious on how to use Unity and make their own things so I streamed the whole process to them.
It covers animations, movement, tiles/tilesets, dialogue, and a few other basic game elements
It is available to play on Itch.Io:
